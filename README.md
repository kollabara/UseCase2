# Application DescriptionThis application is a web service that interacts with the Stripe API to perform balance-related operations. It provides endpoints to retrieve the account balance and balance transactions. The application uses the Stripe SDK to communicate with the Stripe API and handles any errors using the ErrorHandlingMiddleware. It requires a valid Stripe API token to authenticate the requests.The /balance endpoint allows users to retrieve the current account balance. It uses the BalanceService to make a GET request to the Stripe API and returns the balance information as a response.The /balance/transactions endpoint enables users to retrieve a list of balance transactions. It uses the BalanceTransactionService and accepts optional parameters for pagination. The service sends a GET request to the Stripe API with the provided parameters and returns the list of balance transactions as a response.# Running the Application LocallyTo use this application locally, follow these steps:* Install the required dependencies by running dotnet restore in the project directory.* Set up a valid Stripe API token in the configuration file or environment variables.* Build the application by running dotnet build in the project directory.* Start the application by running dotnet run in the project directory.* The application will listen on the configured port (default is 5000) and be accessible at http://localhost:5000.# Example URLsHere are a couple of example URLs that demonstrate how to use the developed endpoints:* Get account balance: http://localhost:5000/balanceThis URL will retrieve the current account balance by making a GET request to the /balance endpoint.* Get balance transactions: http://localhost:5000/balance/transactions?endingBefore=transaction_id&startingAfter=transaction_idThis URL will retrieve a list of balance transactions with pagination support. Replace "transaction_id" with the actual transaction IDs to specify the range of transactions to retrieve. The optional parameters endingBefore and startingAfter are used for pagination.
